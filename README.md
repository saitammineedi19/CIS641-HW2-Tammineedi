## Term Project
The term project for the course System Analysis and Design that I'm doing along with my team developed a software system for Inventory Management System (IMS) that helps firms manage and control their inventory more efficiently. The IMS is a digital solution for recording and storing product information, processing orders, and managing suppliers. It includes various major features and functionalities, such as:
- Product Management(Adding items to the inventory, updating the inventory)
- Data Storage(storing items to the inventory)
- Inventory Transfer(Transferring items from one location to other location)
We used Python programming to develop the system.
